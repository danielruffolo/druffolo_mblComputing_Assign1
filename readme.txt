App is android Ready and IOS compatable

FUNCTIONS
Functions so far :
-create thread
-view thread
-forum thread service/modal
-User interface

NOTE:
Note: A forums app is heavily reliant on server side code.
I plan to build a REST api and host it on Heroku serviers.
For marking, i included how i envision the forum thread's to work in a emulation style manner.
I did not do so for login , accounts and comment systems as they all require heavy server side binding.

TO  Emulate in browser:
ionic serve


TO INSTALL:

If you dont have ionic installed, just open the directory in terminal and write npm install

This has allready been done: ionic cordova platform add android or ios


Build the project:
ionic cordova build android or ios


To build and run the application on an Android device connected to your computer using a USB cable:

ionic cordova run android or ios

To build and run the application in the Android emulator:

ionic cordova emulate android or ios
